<h2>Exercise 10</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator" target="_blank">ternary operator</a> is another useful method for defining a variable to one of two possible values. This can also replace an if and else statement, but can sometimes be confusing when used that way.</p>

<p>Create two new variables, lastName and familyMessage. Set lastName to your last name, then use a ternary that checks whether lastName is equal to your last name to set familyMessage to either "You're part of the family!" or "You're not family."</p>
<script>
var lastName;
var familyMessage;

lastName = 'Lingiah'
familyMessage = lastName === 'Lingiah' ? "You're part of the family!" : "You're not family."

console.log(familyMessage);
</script>
