<h1>Launch Sschool 210 | Lesson 1 Exercises - Operators and Conditionals</h1>
<h2>Exercise 3</h2>
<p>Change the conditional from the previous exercise to use === instead. Why doesn't this one output a message?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> this doesn't output teh message because === tests for strict equality and the string '3' and the integer 3 are different data types.</p>
<script>
var apples = 3;
var bananas = '3';

if (apples === bananas) {
  console.log("Apples are the same as bananas!!")
}
