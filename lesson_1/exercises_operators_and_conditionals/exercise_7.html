<h1>Launch School 210 | Lesson 1 Exercises - Operators and Conditionals</h1>
<h2>Exercise 7</h2>
<p>Set the variables apples and bananas to 3. Set a variable, areEqual, to the value of apples compared to bananas. This works the same way as the if statements we have been writing, but instead of an if and the condition in parentheses, we just use the condition from within the parentheses as the new value for our variable. Log the value of areEqual.</p>
<script>
var apples = 3;
var bananas = 3;
var areEqual = (apples === bananas);

console.log(areEqual);
