<h2>Exercise 8</h2>
<p>Set the value of apples to 3 and bananas to undefined. Set a variable named eitherOr to the value of apples or bananas. This works the same as the previous exercise, where you write the comparison as the assignment of the variable. Log the value of eitherOr.</p>
<script>
var apples = 3;
var bananas;
var eitherOr = (apples || bananas);

console.log(eitherOr);
