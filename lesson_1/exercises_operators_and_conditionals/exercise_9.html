<h2>Exercise 9</h2>
<p>Set the value of bananas to 1. Perform the same assignment for eitherOr. Log the value of eitherOr. Afterward, assign bananas || apples to the eitherOr variable. Note that the value is now the bananas variable instead of apples. JavaScript reads this statement from left to right. If the left-side has a truthy value, it is used. Otherwise, the right-side value is used.</p>
<script>
var apples = 3;
var bananas = 1;
var eitherOr = (apples || bananas);
console.log(eitherOr);
eitherOr = (bananas || apples);
console.log(eitherOr);
</script>
