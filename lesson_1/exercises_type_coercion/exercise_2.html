<h2>Exercise 2</h2>
<p>Using the same block of JavaScript, change the addition operator to a multiplication operator and leave x as a string. Will the result be a string or a number?</p>
<script>
var x = '13';
var y = 9;

console.log(x * y); // result should be an integer as * implicitly coerces strings to integers
</script>
