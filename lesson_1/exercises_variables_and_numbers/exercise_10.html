<h2>Exercise 10</h2>
<p>Write the arithmetic statement that sets a variable answer to the result of 11 plus 31 multiplied by 3 as one statement, then log the result. Your result should be 126. If you get a different result, you may need to use some parentheses to change the order of operations: you want to perform the addition first, then the multiplication.</p>
<script>
var answer = (11 + 31) * 3;
console.log(answer);
