<h2>Exercise 7</h2>
<p>In JavaScript, we can use a shorthand operator to add or subtract values to and from variable. If we want to add one to our incrementer variable, we can write incrementer = incrementer + 1. However, JavaScript lets us shorten this with the self-addition operator, +=, e.g., incrementer += 1. (All we did was remove the second instance of incrementer, and then recombined the = and + as +=.) Analogous arithmetic assignment operators are available for the other basic arithmetic operations: subtraction, multiplication, and division.</p>

<p>Increment the incrementer variable by 1 three times using the self-addition notation.</p>
<script>
var incrementer = 1;
console.log(incrementer);
incrementer += 1;
incrementer += 1;
incrementer += 1;
console.log(incrementer);
</script>
