<h2>Exercise 8</h2>
<p>There's an even shorter way to increment and decrement a variable by one: the increment and decrement operators. To increment a variable by one, we write the variable name immediately followed by two plus signs, e.g., incrementer++. We call this the postfix increment operator since it comes after the variable name.</p>

<p>Increment the incrementer variable by 1 twice using increment operator shorthand.</p>
<script>
var incrementer = 1;
console.log(incrementer);
incrementer++;
incrementer++;
console.log(incrementer);  
</script>
