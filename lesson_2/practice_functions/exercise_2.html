<h2>Exercise 2</h2>
<p>We now need a function that calculates the sum of the same three values. Create a function named sum that takes the same three arguments as average, and returns the sum of the three arguments. Now modify average to call the sum function with those three arguments and use the return value to calculate the average.</p>
<script>
function sum(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}

function average(a, b, c) {
  return sum(a, b, c) / 3;
}

var myAverage = average(4, 5, 6);
console.log(myAverage);
</script>
