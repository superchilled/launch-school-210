<h2>Exercise 3</h2>
<p>Suppose we have a different number of values from which to calculate an average. Our current average function only takes three numbers; we might need to write additional functions if we want to work with different numbers of data points. A better solution, though, is to change the function to accept an array of arbitrary length. We can calculate the average by looping over the array elements to calculate the total, then divide by the array length.</p>

<p>Create a variable named total with an initial value of 0 at the start of the average function. Use a for loop to iterate over all the elements in the array. With each iteration, add the element's value to the total. When the loop finishes, return the total divided by the array's length. Call average with an array of five numbers and log the result.</p>
<script>
function average(arr) {
  var total = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    total += arr[i];
  }
  return total / arr.length;
}

var myAverage = average([10, 9, 8, 7, 6]);
console.log(myAverage);
