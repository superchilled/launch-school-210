<h1>Guessing the Password</h1>
<p>Write a password guessing program that tracks how many times the user enters the wrong password. If the user enters the password wrong three times, log 'You have been denied access.' and terminate the program. If the password is correct, log 'You have successfully logged in.' and end the program.</p>
<script>
// input: string entered into password prompt
// output: log 'You have been denied access.' or 'You have successfully logged in.' depending on input
// algorithm:
// 1) prompt user for password
// 2) check entered password against set password
//  - if they match, log success
//  - if no match prompt return to 1
//  - repeat 3 times, and log failure if no match

var password = 'secret'
var input;
var message = 'You have been denied access.';

for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  input = prompt('What is the password?');
  if (input === password) {
    message = 'You have successfully logged in.';
    break;
  }
}

console.log(message);
