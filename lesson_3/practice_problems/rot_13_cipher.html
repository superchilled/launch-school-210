<h1>Code Review -- Rot13 Cipher</h1>
<p>Rot13 ("rotate by 13 places") is a letter-substitution cipher that translates a String into a new String.</p>

<p>For each character in the original String:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the character is a letter in the modern English alphabet, change it to the character 13 positions later in the alphabet. So a becomes n. If you reach the end of the alphabet, return to the beginning. So o becomes b.</li>
<li>Letter transformations preserve case. A becomes N while a becomes n.</li>
<li>Don't modify characters that are not letters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Write a Function, rot13, that takes a String and returns that String transformed by the rot13 cipher.</p>
