<h2>Exercise 4</h2>
<p>Can we insert data into an array at a negative index? If so, why is this possible?</p>
<script>
// Yes, it is possible to insert data into an array using a negative index since Arrays in JavaScript are objects which effectively act as a Hash Map, so the index is used as the key to access the value. However, the value at a negative index is not 'visible' in the arr since they are arbitrary properties of the array and not actually a 'member' of the array. For this reason such values do not contribute towards the 'length' of the array.

// Example:

var myArr = [1, 2, 3];
myArr.length; // should return 3

myArr[-1] = 0;
myArr[-1]; // should return 0
myArr.length; // should return 3
