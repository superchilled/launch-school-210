<h1>Launch School 210 | Lesson 4 -- Working with Dates</h1>
<h2>Exercise 13</h2>
<p>The <code>===</code> operator only returns <code>true</code> with Date objects if the objects are the same object. Since we have two different objects (with the same values), we must instead compare the values represented by those objects. Compare the values returned by <code>toDateString</code> to determine whether the two objects are equal. Finally, add 7 days to the <code>nextWeek</code> date and compare the two objects again.</p>
<script>
var today = new Date();
var nextWeek = new Date(today.getTime());

console.log(today.toDateString() === nextWeek.toDateString());

nextWeek.setDate(today.getDate() + 7);
console.log(today.toDateString() === nextWeek.toDateString());
</script>
