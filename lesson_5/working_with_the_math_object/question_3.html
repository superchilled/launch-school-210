<h2>Exercise 3</h2>
<p>You can calculate the square of a number by multiplying the number by itself. Calculating the square root takes more work. Fortunately, the <code>Math.sqrt</code> method makes this easier than it would otherwise be. Use this method to find the square root of 16777216.</p>
<script>
var myNum = 16777216;

console.log(Math.sqrt(myNum)); // 4096
