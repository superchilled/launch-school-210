<h2>Exercise 4</h2>
<p>Suppose, instead, that we want to calculate the 6th power of a number. We could multiply a number by itself six times with a function. However, it is easier to just use <code>Math.pow</code>. <code>Math.pow</code> takes two arguments, the base and the exponent, and returns the result. Use <code>Math.pow</code> to compute and log the value of 16 to the 6th power.</p>
<script>
console.log(Math.pow(16, 6)); // 16777216
