<h1>Launch School 210 | Lesson 5 -- Working with the Math Object</h1>
<h2>Exercise 5</h2>
<p>Rounding numbers up or down in JavaScript is easy, but there are three methods that perform different types of rounding. <code>Math.round</code> takes any decimal value and rounds it to the nearest integer. If the fractional part of the number is less than 0.5, <code>Math.round</code> rounds the value downwards; otherwise, it rounds the value upwards. Note: if the fractional part is exactly 0.5, <code>Math.round</code> rounds upwards. <code>Math.floor</code> rounds any number downward to the next lower integer. <code>Math.ceil</code> rounds any number upward to the next higher integer.</p>

<p>Use the appropriate method on each of these variables to return a value of 50. Make sure you use each method once.</p>
<script>
var a = 50.72;
var b = 49.2;
var c = 49.86;

console.log(Math.floor(a));
console.log(Math.ceil(b));
console.log(Math.round(c));
