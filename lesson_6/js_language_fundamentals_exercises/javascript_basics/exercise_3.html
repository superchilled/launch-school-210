<h2>Exercise 3: Conditional</h2>
<p>One of the ways to manage the flow of a program is through the use of conditionals. Go over the code below and specify how many possible flows/paths there are.</p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>There are nested conditionals here, so that creates a number of paths. Within the outer <code>if</code> condition, there are two branches, an <code>if</code> and an <code>else</code>. Within the outer <code>else</code> condition, there are two levels of nesting, both <code>if</code> conditions, so that is three, making 5 branches overall.</p>
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Path1: condition1 - condition2</li>
  <li>Path2: condition1 - not condition2</li>
  <li>Path3: not condition1</li>
  <li>Path4: not condition1 - condition4</li>
  <li>Path5: not condition1 - condition4 - condition5</li>
</ul>
<script>
if (condition1) {
  // some code
  if (condition2) {
    // some code
  } else {
    // some code
  }
} else {
  // some code
  if (condition4) {
    // some code
    if (condition5) {
    // some code
    }
  }
}
