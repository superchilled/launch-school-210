<h2>Exercise 2: Conditional Loop</h2>
<p>Review the code below. The program should log numbers that are multiples of 3 from 0 to 9. Will the expected behavior happen? Why or why not?</p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>NO, because the first time the <code>while</code> loop hits a number for which <code>number % 3</code> equals 0, the <code>else</code> branch of the conditional will not be executed, and so the value of <code>i</code> will not be incrmented. It will result in an infinite loop. in fact this will happen from the first loop since <code>0 % 3 === 0</code> is <code>true</code>.</p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>It becomes an infinite loop because the value of i is never incremented. The expression (i % 3 === 0) will always be true and as such the else clause that contains the incrementer never gets executed. When using a while loop, you have to be wary about managing the variables involved with the iteration and the stopping condition. In the case of this exercise, i should have been incremented at every iteration.</p>
<script>
var i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  if (i % 3 === 0) {
    console.log(i);
  } else {
    i += 1;
  }
}
</script>
