<h2>Exercise 6: Logger</h2>
<p>Read and understand the code below. Why will it log debugging?</p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>It will log <code>'debugging'</code> because <code>debugIt()</code> is called on line 10, this in turn calls <code>logger()</code> which calls <code>console.log()</code> passing <code>status</code> as an argument. Since the value of status is <code>'debugging'</code>, this is what is logged.</p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The status variable on line 4 is debugging because of JavaScript's lexical scoping rules.</p>
<p>The debugIt function creates a local variable called status and a function called logger. logger is an inner function with access to variables declared in its outer/parent function due to lexical scoping rules.</p>
<script>
function debugIt() {
  var status = 'debugging';
  function logger() {
    console.log(status);
  }

  logger();
}

debugIt();
</script>
