<h2>Exercise 2:  	Equal</h2>
<p>Read the code below. Currently, it does not log the result that we want. Can you explain why?</p>
<p>If in our code, we want to be able to have the two person variables return true when we do person === otherPerson, what do we need to do?</p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>The issue here is that the variables point to the objects. Since when objects are compared using <code>===</code>, unless they are the same object, <code>false</code> is returned.</p>
<p>To fix this, we need to compare the values of the <code>name</code> property of the objects</p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>We'll have to make sure the two variables reference the same object, not two different objects with the same keys and values.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, every object literal creates a new object, and when it's assigned to a variable, the variable holds the reference to that object. In our example above, the only way to make the two variables compare equally is to have them reference the same object.</p>
<script>
var person = {name: 'Victor'};
var otherPerson = {name: 'Victor'};

console.log(person === otherPerson);  // false; but we want this to be true

// fixed version
var otherPerson = person;
console.log(person === otherPerson);
</script>
