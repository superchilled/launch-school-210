<h2>Exercise 4: Caller</h2>
<p>The doubler function takes two arguments: a number that it's going to double and return, and a string that indicates the caller of the function.</p>
<p>Can you create a makeDoubler function, which returns a function that's functionally equivalent to doubler, but with the caller preset?</p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p></p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>What's interesting here is that the returned function expression that's assigned to variable doubler still retains access to the caller variable in its closure, even after the makeDoubler function returns.</p>
<script>
function doubler(number, caller) {
  console.log('This function was called by ' + caller + '.');
  return number + number;
}

// doubler(5, 'Victor');       // 10
// This function was called by Victor.

function makeDoubler(caller) {
  return function(number) {
    console.log('This function was called by ' + caller + '.');
    return number + number;
  };
}

var doubler = makeDoubler('Victor');
test1 = doubler(5);                 // 10
// This function was called by Victor.
console.log(test1);
</script>
