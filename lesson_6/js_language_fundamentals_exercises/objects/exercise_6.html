<h2>Exercise 6: Array Object 2</h2>
<p>The function below takes an array as argument and returns its average. The user of the function put in the statements below and was expecting the function to return 5 to test it. What is the value returned?</p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>The value returned will be <code>10</code>, since the <code>for</code> loop references the <code>-2</code> and <code>-1</code> properties as well as the array items, it sums <code>5</code> 4 times, making a total of <code>20</code>, which it then divides by <code>array.length</code>, which is <code>2</code>, producing <code>10</code>.</p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>A non-positive integer key is not considered as part of an array's length. As such the length is only 2 when the sum of the elements were divided (20 / 2).</p>
<script>
var myArray = [5, 5];
myArray[-1] = 5;
myArray[-2] = 5;
function average(array) {
  var sum = 0;
  for (var i = -2; i < array.length; i++) {
    sum += array[i];
  }

  return sum / array.length;
}

average(myArray);
</script>
