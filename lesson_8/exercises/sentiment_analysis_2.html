<h1>Launch School 210 | String and Text Processing: Sentiment Analysis 2</h1>
<p>Re-implement the sentiment analysis with regex-based positive and negative word lists. The use of regex to process text-based data is extremely powerful. In the previous practice problem, we did not count words that were just different forms of the words in the positive and negative word lists. For instance, we didn't count "scorns" since it isn't an exact match for "scorn".</p>

<p>We could add the variations of each word; for example: fortune --> fortunes, respect --> respected, oppress --> oppressed, or death --> deaths. This works, but we can use regex to make the relationship between variants more evident:</p>
<script>
// input: A string, containing 'positive' and 'negative' words.
// output: a log of 5 things to the console:
//  1) A string containing the number of positive words
//  2) A string containing a list of the positive words
//  3) A string containing the number of positive words
//  4) A string containing a list of the positive words
//  5) A string containing the overall sentiment of the words (positive, negative, neutral)
//  Note: 2& 3 and 4& 5 are separated by a space
// algorithm:
//  1) Declare two variables, positiveWordsCaptured and negativeWordsCaptured and assign them to empty arrays
//  2) Downcase the string, remove all puntuation and split the string to create an array of words (split on spaces and new lines)
//  3) Iterate through the array of words, for each iteration:
//    - check the word for that iteration against the existing arrays of positive and negative words:
//      - if it is positive add it to the positiveWordsCaptured array
//      - if it is negative add it to the negativeWordsCaptured array
//  4) Log the followingto the console:
//    - A count of positiveWordsCaptured to the console
//    - A concatenated list of the positiveWordsCaptured to the console
//    - A count of negativeWordsCaptured to the console
//    - A concatenated list of the negativeWordsCaptured to the console
//    - The overall sentiment depending on which count is higher
