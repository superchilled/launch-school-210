<p>Create variables named fact1 and fact2 and set them equal to 'JavaScript is fun' and 'Kids like it too', respectively. Combine the values of the two variables with the string ' and ' between them, and store the result in a variable named compoundSentence. Make sure the first letter of fact2 shows up as lowercase in compoundSentence. Log the value of compoundSentence.</p>
<script>
var fact1 = 'JavaScript is fun';
var fact2 = 'Kids like it too';
var compoundSentence = fact1 + ' and ' + fact2.toLowerCase();
