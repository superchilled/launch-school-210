<h2>Exercise 2: Transpose 3x3</h2>
<p>A 3x3 matrix can be represented by an array of arrays: an outer array containing three subarrays that each contain three elements. For example, the 3x3 matrix shown below:<br/>
<code>
1  5  8<br/>
4  7  2<br/>
3  9  6<br/>
</code>
is represented by the following array of arrays:<br/>
<code>
var matrix = [<br/>
  [1, 5, 8],<br/>
  [4, 7, 2],<br/>
  [3, 9, 6],<br/>
];
</code>
</p>

<p>An array of arrays is sometimes called a "nested array" because each inner subarray is nested inside an outer array. It also may be called a "two-dimensional array"</p>

<p>To access an element in the matrix, you can use bracket notation twice (such as array[][]), and include both the row index and column index within the brackets. Given the above matrix, matrix[0][2] is 8, and matrix[2][1] is 9. An entire row in the matrix can be referenced using a single index: matrix[1] is the row (subarray) [4, 7, 2]. Furthermore, given a row, we can determine the total number of columns by counting the number of elements in the row. Unfortunately, a convenient notation for accessing an entire column does not exist.</p>

<p>The transpose of a 3x3 matrix is the matrix that results from exchanging the rows and columns of the original matrix. For example, the transposition of the matrix shown above is:<br/>
<code>
1  4  3<br/>
5  7  9<br/>
8  2  6<br/>
</code>
</p>

<p>Write a function that takes an array of arrays representing a 3x3 matrix, and returns the transpose of the matrix. You should implement the function on your own, without using any external libraries.</p>

<p>Take care not to modify the original matrix â€” your function must produce a new matrix and leave the input matrix array unchanged.</p>

/*
Input: A matrix (nested array) of three rows by three columns
Output: A transposed matrix with the rows and columns swapped
Rules:
  - [0][0] => [0][0], [1][0] => [0][1], [2][0] => [0][2]...
Algorithm:
  1) Declare a variable assigned to a new matrix which is an array of three empty arrays
  2) Loop through each element in the input matrix. For each element (subarray), loop again:
    - On the inner loop, reverse the 'outer index' and 'inner index' and use the reversed indices to set the element in the newMatrix
  3) Return the new matrix

function transpose(matrix) {
  var newMatrix = Array.from({length: matrix[0].length}, elem => []);
  matrix.forEach((outerElem, outerIdx) => {
    outerElem.forEach((innerElem, innerIdx) => {
      newMatrix[innerIdx][outerIdx] = innerElem;
    });
  });
  return newMatrix;
}

var matrix = [
  [1, 5, 8],
  [4, 7, 2],
  [3, 9, 6]
];

var newMatrix = transpose(matrix);

console.log(newMatrix);      // [[1, 4, 3], [5, 7, 9], [8, 2, 6]]
console.log(matrix);         // [[1, 5, 8], [4, 7, 2], [3, 9, 6]]
