<h1>LS 210 | Small Problems: Advanced 1</h1>
<h2>Exercise 3: Transpose MxN</h2>
<p>In the previous exercise, you wrote a function that transposed a 3x3 matrix represented by an array of arrays.</p>

<p>Matrix transposes are not limited to 3x3 matrices, or even square matrices. Any matrix can be transposed simply by switching columns with rows.</p>

<p>Modify your transpose function from the previous exercise so that it works with any MxN matrix with at least one row and one column.</p>
<script>
/*
Input: A matrix (nested array) of three rows by three columns
Output: A transposed matrix with the rows and columns swapped
Rules:
  - [0][0] => [0][0], [1][0] => [0][1], [2][0] => [0][2]...
Algorithm:
  1) Declare a variable assigned to a new matrix which is an array of three empty arrays
  2) Loop through each element in the input matrix. For each element (subarray), loop again:
    - On the inner loop, reverse the 'outer index' and 'inner index' and use the reversed indices to set the element in the newMatrix
  3) Return the new matrix
ORIGINAL SOLUTION SHOULD STILL WORK HERE

function transpose(matrix) {
  var newMatrix = Array.from({length: matrix[0].length}, elem => []);
  matrix.forEach((outerElem, outerIdx) => {
    outerElem.forEach((innerElem, innerIdx) => {
      newMatrix[innerIdx][outerIdx] = innerElem;
    });
  });
  return newMatrix;
}

console.log(transpose([[1, 2, 3, 4]]));            // [[1], [2], [3], [4]]
console.log(transpose([[1], [2], [3], [4]]));      // [[1, 2, 3, 4]]
console.log(transpose([[1]]));                     // [[1]]
console.log(transpose([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [4, 3, 2, 1, 0], [3, 7, 8, 6, 2]]));
// [[1, 4, 3], [2, 3, 7], [3, 2, 8], [4, 1, 6], [5, 0, 2]]
