<h1>LS 210 | Small Problems: Advanced 1</h1>
<h2>Exercise 5: Merge Sorted Lists</h2>
<p>Write a function that takes two sorted arrays as arguments, and returns a new array that contains all the elements from both input arrays in sorted order.</p>

<p>You may not provide any solution that requires you to sort the result array. You must build the result array one element at a time in the proper order.</p>

<p>Your solution should not mutate the input arrays</p>
<script>
/*
Input: Two sorted arrays of integer numbers
Output: A single array ith the elements from the sorted arrays in order
Rules:
  - The elements in the two input arays are already sorted (from lowest to highest)
  - The output array must be built one element at a time
  - Comparison should only be done while both arrays have elements, otherwise should just take remaining elements from the array that still has them
Algorithm:
  1) Declare an empty output array
  2) Compare the length of the two input arrays and assign variables (shortest, longest) accordingly (if they are the same length order doesn't matter).
  3) Iterate from through each element of the shortest array. On each iteration:
    - Compare the elements at index 0 of both input arrays.
      - If the element at index 0 of the shortest array is lower, remove that element and add it to the output array
      - Otherwise remove the first element from the longest array and add that to the output array
  4) If the longest aray still has elements left, iterate through each element, removig it and adding it to the output array
  5) returnt he output array
