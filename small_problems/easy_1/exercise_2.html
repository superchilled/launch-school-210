<h1>LS 210 | Small Problems: Easy 1</h1>
<h2>Exercise 2: Even Numbers</h2>
<p>Log the even numbers from 1 to 99, inclusive, to the console. Log all numbers on separate lines.</p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>This is basically the same as the previous problem but with a differnt value for the initialization and a different value for the condition.</p>
<p>The conditional in the 'further exploration' solution would also be slightly different</p>
<script>
for (var i = 2; i < 99; i += 2) {
  console.log(i);
}

// Further exploration
function logEvens(start, end) {
  for (var i = start; i <= end; i++) {
    if (i % 2 === 0) {
      console.log(i);
    }
  }
}
</script>
