<h1>LS 210 | Small Problems: Easy 1</h1>
<h2>Exercise 3: How Big is the Room</h2>
<p>Build a program that asks a user for the length and width of a room in meters and then logs to the console the area of the room in both square meters and square feet.</p>
<p>Note: 1 square meter == 10.7639 square feet</p>
<p>Do not worry about validating the input at this time. Use the prompt() function to collect user input.</p>
<code>
  Enter the length of the room in meters:<br>
  10<br>
  Enter the width of the room in meters:<br>
  7<br>
  The area of the room is 70.0 square meters (753.47 square feet).
</code>
<script>
var roomLength = prompt('Enter the length of the room in meters:');
var roomWidth = prompt('Enter the width of the room in meters:');
var roomSizeInSquareMetres = Number.parseInt(roomLength, 10) * Number.parseInt(roomWidth, 10);
var roomSizeInSquareFeet = roomSizeInSquareMetres * 10.7639;

console.log('The area of the room is ' +  String(roomSizeInSquareMetres.toFixed(2)) +
    ' square meters (' + String(roomSizeInSquareFeet.toFixed(2)) + ' square feet).');
