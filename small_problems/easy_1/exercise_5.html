<h1>LS 210 | Small Problems: Easy 1</h1>
<h2>Exercise 5: Sum or Product of Consecutive Integers</h2>
<p>Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer greater than 0, then asks if the user wants to determine the sum or product of all numbers between 1 and the entered integer.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<code>
  Please enter an integer greater than 0: 5<br/>
  Enter "s" to compute the sum, "p" to compute the product. s<br/>
  <br/>
  The sum of the integers between 1 and 5 is 15.
</code>
<br/>
<code>
  Please enter an integer greater than 0: 6<br/>
  Enter "s" to compute the sum, "p" to compute the product. p<br/>
<br/>
  The product of the integers between 1 and 6 is 720.
</code>
<script>
var integer = Number.parseInt(prompt('Please enter an integer greater than 0:'), 10);
var operationInput = prompt('Enter "s" to compute the sum, "p" to compute the product.');
var rangeArray = Array.from({length: integer}, (element ,idx) => idx + 1);
var sum;
var operation;
if (operationInput === 's') {
  sum = rangeArray.reduce( (total, value) => total + value);
  operation = 'sum';
} else if (operationInput === 'p') {
  sum = rangeArray.reduce( (total, value) => total * value);
  operation = 'product';
}

console.log('The ' + operation + ' of the integers between 1 and ' +  String(integer) + ' is ' + String(sum));
