<h2>Exercise 4: Fibonacci Number Location by Length</h2>
<p>The Fibonacci series is a series of numbers (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...) such that the first 2 numbers are 1 by definition, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous numbers. This series appears throughout the natural world.</p>

<p>Computationally, the Fibonacci series is a simple series, but the results grow at an incredibly rapid rate. For example, the 100th Fibonacci number is 354,224,848,179,261,915,075 -- that's enormous, especially considering that it takes 6 iterations just to find the first 2 digit Fibonacci number.</p>

<p>Write a function that calculates and returns the index of the first Fibonacci number that has the number of digits specified as an argument. (The first Fibonacci number has index 1.)</p>

/*
Input: An integer number
Output: An 'index' which represents the position in the sequence of Fibonacci numbers of the firstnumber matching the condition
  Rules:
    - The condition to be matched is that the number has a number of digits equal to the input number
Algorithm:
  1) Declare an index varaible assigned to 1
  2) Declare a previousNum variable assigned to 0
  3) Declare a currentNum variable equal to 1
  4) Declare a function which calculates the number of digits in a number passed to it (transforms to string and calls length)
  5) Loop while number of digits in current number not equalto input number. On each iteration:
    - Declare a varaible called new number and assign it to current number + previous number
    - Assign previous number ot current number
    - Assign current number to new number
    - Increment index by 1
  6) return index
