<h1>LS 210 | Small Problems: Easy 2</h1>
<h2>Exercise 5: Right Triangles</h2>
<p>Write a function that takes a positive integer, n, as an argument, and logs a right triangle whose sides each have n stars. The hypotenuse of the triangle (the diagonal side in the images below) should have one end at the lower-left of the triangle, and the other end at the upper-right.</p>

/*
Input: an integer number
Output: A log of strings, the number of strings equl to the input number
  Rules:
    - Each string has a number of characters equal to the input number
      - The characters in the first string are (width - 1 * ' ') + '*'
      - The characters in the last string are width * '*'
      - The intermediate stings decrement the number of spaces by 1 and increment the number of stars by one each time
Algorithm:
  1) Declare a variable called spaces assigned to width - 1
  2) Declare a variable called stars assigned to 1
  3) Loop through from 1 until the width. On each iteration:
    - log ' ' repated spaces times concatenated with '*' repeated stars times
*/

function triangle(width) {
  var spaces = width - 1;
  var stars = 1;
  for (var i = 1; i <= width; i++) {
    var line = ' '.repeat(spaces) + '*'.repeat(stars);
    console.log(line);
    spaces--;
    stars++;
  }
}

triangle(5);
