<h2>Exercise 6: Madlibs</h2>
<p>Madlibs is a simple game where you create a story template with blanks for words. You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result.</P>

<p>Create a simple madlib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb, and an adjective and injects those into a story that you create.</p>
<code>
  Enter a noun: dog<br/>
  Enter a verb: walk<br/>
  Enter an adjective: blue<br/>
  Enter an adverb: quickly<br/>
<br/>
  // console output<br/>
  Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!<br/>
</code>
<script>
var noun = prompt('Enter a noun:');
var verb = prompt('Enter a verb:');
var adjective = prompt('Enter an adjective:');
var adverb = prompt('Enter an adverb:');
var madlib = "Do you " + verb + " your " + adjective + " " + noun + " " + adverb + "? That's hilarious!";

console.log(madlib);
