<h2>Exercise 9: Clean Up the Words</h2>
<p>Given a string that consists of some words and an assortment of non-alphabetic characters, write a function that returns that string with all of the non-alphabetic characters replaced by spaces. If one or more non-alphabetic characters occur in a row, you should only have one space in the result (the result should never have consecutive spaces).</p>
<script>
/*
Input: A string
Output: A 'cleaned up' version of the string
Rules:
  - A cleaned up string should only consist of alphabetic characters and spaces
  - A cleaned up string should never contain more than one consecutive space
Algorithm:
  1) Use the string replace method with a regex
*/

function cleanUp(str) {
  return str.replace(/[^a-zA-Z]+/g, ' ');
}


console.log(cleanUp('---what\'s my +*& line?'));      // ' what s my line '
