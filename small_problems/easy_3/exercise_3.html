<h2>Exercise 3: When Will I Retire</h2>
<p>Build a program that logs when the user will retire and how many years the user has to work till retirement.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<code>
  What is your age? 30<br/>
  At what age would you like to retire? 70<br/>
<br/>
  It's 2016. You will retire in 2056.<br/>
  You have only 40 years of work to go!<br/>
</code>
<script>
/*
Input: an integer string representing an age and an integer string representing a desired retirement age
Output: A log of two strings to the console:
  - A sentence stating the current year and retirement year
  - A sentence stating the number of years left to work
Algorithm:
  1) Declare a variable and assign to input of age
  2) declare a variable ans assign to input of desired retirement date
  3) declare a variable and assign to current year (using a date object)
  4) subtract the current age from retirement age and (converting to integers from strings as required), assign the result to yearsLeftToWork
  5) Log the first sentnce, interpolating the current year and the current year + yearsLeftToWork
  6) Log the second sentence interpolating the years left ot work
*/

var age = prompt('What is your age?', 10);
var desiredRetirementAge = prompt('At what age would you like to retire?', 10);
var date = new Date();
var currentYear = date.getFullYear();
var yearsLeftToWork = Number.parseInt(desiredRetirementAge) - Number.parseInt(age);
console.log(`It's ${currentYear}. You will retire in ${currentYear + yearsLeftToWork}.`);
console.log(`You have only ${yearsLeftToWork} years of work to go!`);
