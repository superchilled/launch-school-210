<h1>LS 210 | Small Problems: Easy 3</h1>
<h2>Exercise 7: Running Totals</h2>
<p>Write a function that takes an array of numbers, and returns an array with the same number of elements with each elements value being running total from the original array.</p>
<script>
/*
Input: An array of numbers
Output: An array witht he same number of elements, but each element being replaced by the 'running total' at that point in the array
Rules: running total is calculated by adding all the elements in the array up to that point
Algorithm:
      1) Map each item in the array. The function to map should:
        - slice the array from teh start to the current index
        - reduce the sliced array by summing the values
*/

function runningTotal(arr) {
  return arr.map((_, idx) =>
    arr.slice(0, idx + 1).reduce((total, val) => total + val)
  );
}

console.log(runningTotal([2, 5, 13]));             // [2, 7, 20]
console.log(runningTotal([14, 11, 7, 15, 20]));    // [14, 25, 32, 47, 67]
console.log(runningTotal([3]));                    // [3]
console.log(runningTotal([]));                     // []
