<h1>LS 210 | Small Problems: Easy 4</h1>
<h2>Exercise 1: Cute Angles</h2>
<p>Write a function that takes a floating point number that represents an angle between 0 and 360 degrees and returns a String that represents that angle in degrees, minutes, and seconds. You should use a degree symbol (˚) to represent degrees, a single quote (') to represent minutes, and a double quote (") to represent seconds. There are 60 minutes in a degree, and 60 seconds in a minute.</p>
<script>
/*
Input: A floating point number, between 0 and 360
Output: A string comprising of an integer number of degrees, minutes and seconds
Rules:
  - The absolute part of the floating point number represents the degrees
  - The fractional part of the floating point number represents the minutes and seconds
  - When the fractional part is multiplied by sixty, the absolute part represents minutes and the fractional part seconds
  - When the franctional part of that calculation is multiplied by 60, the absolute part represents the seconds
Algorithm:
  1) Get the absolute degrees by calling Math.floor() on the input.
  2) Get the fractional degrees part by subtracting the absolute degrees from the input
  3) Get the floating point minutes by multiplying the fractional degrees by 60
  4) get the absolute minutes by calling math floor on the floating point minutes
  5) get the fractional minutes part by subtracting the absolute minutes from the floating point minutes
  6) get the floating point seconds by multiplying the fractional minutes by 60
  7) get the absolute seconds by calling Math.floor() on the floating point seconds
  8) Return all the relevant values appropriately concatenated into a string
