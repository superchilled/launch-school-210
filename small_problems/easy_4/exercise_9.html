<h1>LS 210 | Small Problems: Easy 4</h1>
<h2>Exercise 9: How Many</h2>
<p>Write a function that counts the number of occurrences of each element in a given array. Once counted, log each element alongside the number of occurrences.</p>
<script>
/*
Input: An array of strings, some of which occur more than once
Output: Console output in the form 'string => num' which lists each string and the number of times it occurs in the array
Algorithm:
  1) Declare a count variable assigned to an empty object
  2) iterate thorugh the array, on each iteration
    - if the value already exists as a key in the object, increment tht key's value by 1
    - if the value doesn't already exist as a key, assign that key a vlaue of 1
  3) Iterate through the keys of the object, for each key, log the key and value in the form specified
*/

function countOccurrences(arr) {
  var occurences = {};
  arr.forEach(function(elem) {
    if (occurences[elem]) {
      occurences[elem] += 1;
    } else {
      occurences[elem] = 1;
    }
  });
  Object.keys(occurences).forEach(elem => console.log(`${elem} => ${occurences[elem]}`));
}

var vehicles = ['car', 'car', 'truck', 'car', 'SUV', 'truck', 'motorcycle', 'motorcycle', 'car', 'truck'];
countOccurrences(vehicles);

/* console output
car => 4
truck => 3
SUV => 1
motorcycle => 2
