<h1>Launch School 210 | Small Problems: Interpretive Problem Solving</h1>
<h2>1000 Lights</h2>
<p>You have a bank of switches before you, numbered from 1 to n. Every switch is connected to exactly one light that is initially off. You walk down the row of switches and toggle every one of them. You walk back to the beginning of the row and start another pass. On this second pass, you toggle switches 2, 4, 6, and so on. On the third pass, you go back to the beginning again, this time toggling switches 3, 6, 9, and so on. You continue to repeat this process until you have gone through n repetitions.</p>

<p>Write a program that takes one argument—the total number of switches—and returns an array of the lights that are on after n repetitions.</p>
<script>
/*
input: An integer indicating the number of lights and number of repetitions
output: An array of which lights are left on after all the repetitions are complete
data structures:
  - A structure to represent the lights. Needs to record the lights number (1, 2, 3, etc..) and its current status (on or off). Us an object {1: true, 2: false, ...}

rules and edge cases:
  - repetitions are done in a specific order:
    - 1st round EVERY light toggled
    - 2nd round EVERY second light toggled
    - 3rd round EVERY third lights toggled
    - 4th round EVERY fourth light
    .....
algorithm:
 1) Declare a lights variable and assign it to an empty object
 2) Loop from 1 to input number. On each iteration
 - Loop from 1 to the input number. On each iteration:
  - If the number for that iteration % the number for the iteration of the outer loop === 0 AND the number for that iteration is <= the input number, toggle the value for that number in the object
 3) Filter the keys lights object according to whether the corresponding value in the light object is on or off
 4) Return the filtered keys
*/

function lightsOn(num) {
  var lights = {};

  for (var i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
    for (var j = i; j <= num; j += i) {
      lights[j] = !lights[j];
    }
  }
  return Object.keys(lights).filter(light => lights[light]);
}

console.log(lightsOn(5));        // [1, 4]
// Detailed result of each round for `5` lights
// Round 1: all lights are on
// Round 2: lights 2 and 4 are now off;     1, 3, and 5 are on
// Round 3: lights 2, 3, and 4 are now off; 1 and 5 are on
// Round 4: lights 2 and 3 are now off;     1, 4, and 5 are on
// Round 5: lights 2, 3, and 5 are now off; 1 and 4 are on

console.log(lightsOn(100));      // [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
