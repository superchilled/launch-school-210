<h2>Diamonds</h2>
<p>Write a function that displays a four-pointed diamond in an nxn grid, where n is an odd integer supplied as an argument to the function. You may assume that the argument will always be an odd integer.</p>
<script>
/*
input: An odd integer
output: Log of a text lines made up of spaces and stars, representing a 'diamond' shape with the width of the input integer
data structures:
  - Each 'row' of the diamond is represented by a string made up of spaces and star characters
    - The first row has one star characters
    - The second row has three star characters
    - The third row has 5 star characters
    - etc..
    - The stars in each row are prepended by a number of spaces equal to the input number minus the number of stars for that row then divided by 2,
      - e.g. if input is 5 and stars on the row is 1, then spaces = (5 - 1) / 2; i.e. 2
algorithm:
 1) Declare a variable for the the diamond and assign it to an array made up of odd numbers from 1 up to the input numbers
 2) Concat that array with a reversed version of itself exluding the last element
 3) Map the resulting array of number so that each integer is transofrmed to the appropraite number of spaces and stars.
 4) Join the array with newline characters and return it

function makeLine(line, width) {
  var spaces = (width - line) / 2;
  return ' '.repeat(spaces) + '*'.repeat(line);
}

function diamond(width) {
  // var diamondArr = createDiamondArr(width);
  var diamondArr = Array.from({length: width}, (elem, i) => i + 1).filter(elem => elem % 2 === 1);
  diamondArr = diamondArr.concat(diamondArr.slice(0, diamondArr.length - 1).reverse())
  return diamondArr.map(line => makeLine(line, width)).join('\n');
