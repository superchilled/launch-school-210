<h2>Vigenere Cipher</h2>
<p>The Vigenere Cipher encrypts alphabetic text using polyalphabetic substitution. It uses a series of Caesar Ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. Each letter of the keyword is treated as a shift value. For instance, the letter 'B' corresponds to a shift value of 1, and the letter 'd' corresponds to a shift value of 3. In other words, the shift value used for a letter is equal to its index value in the alphabet. This means that the letters 'a'-'z' are equivalent to the numbers 0-25. The uppercase letters 'A'-'Z' are also equivalent to 0-25.</p>

<p>Applying the Vigenere Cipher is done sequentially for each character by applying the current shift value to a Caesar Cipher for that particular character. To make this more concrete, let's look at the following example:<br/>
<code>
  plaintext: Pineapples don't go on pizzas!<br/>
  keyword: meat<br/>
<br/>
  Applying the Vigenere Cipher for each alphabetic character:<br/>
  plaintext : Pine appl esdo ntgo onpi zzas<br/>
  shift     : meat meat meat meat meat meat<br/>
  ciphertext: Bmnx mtpe qwdh zxgh arpb ldal<br/>
<br/>
  result: Bmnxmtpeqw dhz'x gh ar pbldal!<br/>
</code>
</p>

<p>Notice that in the example, the key isn't moved forward if the character isn't in the alphabet. Like the Caesar Cipher, the Vigenere Cipher only encrypts alphabetic characters.</p>

<p>Write a function that implements the Vigenere Cipher. The case of the keyword doesn't matterâ€”in other words, the resulting encryption won't change depending on the case of the keyword's letters (e.g., 'MEat' === 'mEaT').</p>
