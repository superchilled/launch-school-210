<h1>LS 210 | Small Problems: List Processing</h1>
<h2>Exercise 3: Multiply All Pairs</h2>
<p>Write a function that takes two Array arguments in which each Array contains a list of numbers, and returns a new Array that contains the product of every pair of numbers that between the elements of the two Arrays. Sort the results in increasing value.</p>

<p>You may assume that neither argument is an empty Array.</p>
<script>
/*
Input: Two arrays, each containing integers
Output: A new array containing the products of all the permutations of pairs of numbers in the two arrays, sorted in ascending numerical order
Rules:
  - A pair consists of one number from the first array and one from the second
  - All the pairs from both arrays represents all the possible combinations of numbers between the arrays
Algorithm:
  1) Declare an variable assigned to an empty array
  2) Iterate through all the numbers in the first array. On each iteration
    - iterate through all the numbers in the second array. On each iteration
      - Multiply the number for that iteration with the number for the 'outer' iteration and push it to the product array
  3) Sort the product array and return it

function multiplyAllPairs(arr1, arr2) {
  var returnArr = [];
  arr1.forEach(function(outerNum) {
    arr2.forEach(function(innerNum) {
      returnArr.push(outerNum * innerNum);
    });
  });

  return returnArr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
}

var test1 = multiplyAllPairs([2, 4], [4, 3, 1, 2])
console.log(test1); // [2, 4, 4, 6, 8, 8, 12, 16]
