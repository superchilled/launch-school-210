<h2>Exercise 6: Fibonacci Numbers (Recursion)</h2>
<p>The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The first two Fibonacci numbers are 1 and 1. The third number is 1 + 1 = 2, the fourth is 1 + 2 = 3, the fifth is 2 + 3 = 5, and so on. In mathematical terms, this can be represented as:
  <code>
    F(1) = 1<br/>
    F(2) = 1<br/>
    F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) where n > 2
  </code>
</p>

<p>This simple sequence can easily be computed using a recursive function. A recursive function is one in which the function calls itself. For example, the following function is a recursive function that computes the sum of all integers between 1 and n:
  <code>
    function sum(n) {<br/>
      if (n === 1) {<br/>
        return 1;<br/>
      } else {<br/>
        return n + sum(n - 1);<br/>
      }<br/>
    }
  </code>
</p>

<p>A good recursive function has three primary qualities:
  <ul>
    <li>It calls itself at least once.</li>
    <li>It has an ending condition — e.g., if (n === 1), in the sum function above.</li>
    <li>The results of each recursion are used in each step — e.g., n + sum(n - 1) uses sum(n - 1).</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>Write a recursive function that computes the nth Fibonacci number, where nth is an argument passed to the function.</p>

<p>NOTE: This exercise verges on the Advanced level of exercises, so do not be discouraged if you are not able to solve it on your own; recursion is tricky, and even experienced developers can have difficulty dealing with it.</p>

/*
Input: An integer representing the length of a fibonacci sequence
Output: The final number in that sequence
Rules:
  - The first two numbers in the sequence are '1'
  - Subsequent numbers in the sequence are calculated from the previous two numbers summed together
Algorithm:
  1) Use a conditional to determine if the length of the sequence is equal to 2
    - If it is then return 1
    - If not, return the sum of two calls to the fibonacci function with sequence_length -1 and sequence_length -2 as the arguments
*/

function fibonacci(sequence_length) {
  if (sequence_length <= 2) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return fibonacci(sequence_length - 1) + fibonacci(sequence_length - 2);
  }
}

console.log(fibonacci(1));       // 1
console.log(fibonacci(2));       // 1
console.log(fibonacci(3));       // 2
console.log(fibonacci(4));       // 3
console.log(fibonacci(5));       // 5
console.log(fibonacci(12));      // 144
console.log(fibonacci(20));      // 6765
