<h1>LS 210 | Small Problems: Medium 2</h1>
<h2>Exercise 5: Next Featured Number Higher than a Given Value</h2>
<p>A 'featured number' (something unique to this exercise) is an odd number that is a multiple of 7, with all of its digits occuring exactly once each. For example, 49 is a featured number, but 98 is not (it is not odd), 97 is not (it is not a multiple of 7), and 133 is not (the digit 3 appears twice).</p>

<p>Write a function that takes an integer as an argument, and returns the next featured number greater than the integer. Issue an error message if there is no next featured number.</p>
<script>
/*
Input: An integer number
Output: An integer number that is larger than the input number and also a 'featured number'
Rules:
  - A featured number is a multiple of 7
  - A featured number's digits occur only once in the number
    - Therefore a featured number cannot have more than 10 digits and cannot be higher than 9876543210
Algorithm:
  1) Iterate from the input number +1 to 9876543210. On each iteration
    - Test if the number is a multiple of 7
    - Test if teh number is odd
    - Test if the digits in the number are not repeated
    - If both these conditions are met return the number
  2) If iteration completes without a number being found, return 'No number found'
The tests:
Multiple of 7 -
  - Divide the number by 7 and test if the result is an integer
Non-repeated digits -
  - Transform to a string
  - Iterate through each character in the string. On each iteration:
    - Match the remainder of the string (i.e. slice from 1 more than the current index) with the current character. If there is a match, return false
  - If iteration completes with no match, return true
