<h1>LS 210 | Small Problems: String and Text Processing</h1>
<h2>Exercise 8: How long are you</h2>
<p>Write a function that takes a string as an argument, and returns an Array that contains every word from the string with the length of the word joined to it by a blank space.</p>

<p>You may assume that one blank space separates words in the string.</p>
<script>
/*
Input: A string
Output: An array of strings, each string is a word in the original string pluss its length
Rules:
  - words can be made up of any character, even non-alphanumeric
  - words are separated by spaces
  - the words in the resulting array must be made up of the original word, a space then the word length
Algorithm:
  1) Split the string into an array of words
  2) map each word to the word pluss it's length, separated by a space
  3) returnt he mapped array
*/

function wordLengths(str) {
  if (str.length === 0) { return [] };
  return str.split(' ').map(word => `${word} ${word.length}`);
}

console.log(wordLengths('cow sheep chicken')); // ['cow 3', 'sheep 5', 'chicken 7']
console.log(wordLengths('baseball hot dogs and apple pie')); // ['baseball 8', 'hot 3', 'dogs 4', 'and 3', 'apple 5', 'pie 3']
console.log(wordLengths('It ain\'t easy, is it?')); // ['It 2', 'ain\'t 5', 'easy, 5', 'is 2', 'it? 3']
console.log(wordLengths('Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious')); // ['Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious 34']
console.log(wordLengths('')); // []
